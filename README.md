This project is an end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether a patient has diabetes or not based on medical report inputs. It utilizes the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm from the scikit-learn library to create the predictive model.

# Project Overview: The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diabetes.

By providing the model with relevant medical report inputs, it can predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes or not.

Dataset: The dataset used for this project contains a set of features such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, BMI, age, etc., along with a binary target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

# Installation: To run this project, you need to have Python installed.

Additionally, you need to install the following libraries: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas.

You can install these libraries using pip: bash Copy code: pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas Usage.



# In the last code snippet input the medical report data for the and get the prediction.
